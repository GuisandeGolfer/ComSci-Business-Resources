# ComSci-Business-Resources

> This is going to be a repository of the resouces that I find online surrounding a variety of topics:

1. Computer Science
2. Entrepeneurship
3. Building Software-as-a-Service products
4. Programming
5. Data Structures & Algorithms 
6. AI tools 
7. Blogging 
8. Online Marketing 
9. etc.

I may end up separating these topics into different pages but for now I am going to embed these hyperlinks into this README.md.

still need to figure out how to make links to other files in a Github repo.
